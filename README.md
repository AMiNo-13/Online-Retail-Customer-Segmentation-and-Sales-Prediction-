## Online Retail Time Series Analysis & Forecast

### Overview

Due to the pandemic, online sales became very crucial for businesses. One of the tools to maintain their success is to use time series analysis. A major benefit of time series analysis is that it can be the basis to forecast data. This is because time series analysis — by its very nature — uncovers patterns in data, which can then be used to predict future data points. In my research I used ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average time-series) analysis to create daily and weekly forecasting models for the top 10 products and total sales.
 

### Online Retail Business

The world of online sales is becoming increasingly complex as more and more people begin to buy and sell goods online. The global online retail market size was valued at USD 4.25 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4% from 2020 to 2027. Increasing usage of smartphones and the convenience of purchasing daily essentials and luxury products from the comfort of home is primarily driving the growth. The internet has revolutionized the retail industry by increasing the reach of retailers from the local area to overseas, allowing the business to reach the expediency of customer and increasing the cross-broader success.

### Our Data

This is a transnational dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Most sales comes from UK and about 90% customers also are from UK, outside UK, most of the sales are from Europe. In my research I analyzed and studied this dataset and used time series analysis to build a model using ARIMA for the top products and total sales to find the best model that can help and guide the company future decisions.


### The Model and Results





### Conclusions

This peformance represents a first step in sales prediction and analysis. There is still improvement can be done to improve our model, and much improvement is required before deployment; however, these results do suggest that our model is doing well and can be improved. Our RFM analysis can give a valuable insights for business direct marketing.

### The Future

The potential applications of this technology are only limited by quantity and quality of data. Some next steps for this dataset would be to:
-  **More data from different countries.** Since the data is mostly UK based, it would nice to get more data from its international customers to have better model.  
-  **More diverse data.** Since we created two datasets, we would like use these two datasets separately to have more standardized data for a model because there can be some patterns that work for other countries and do not for UK or vise versa.  
- **Data on other online retail businesses.** I would like to use my model on different online retail data to see how it would performs against other datasets. This way we can improve our model better
